      This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the
      people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many
      solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely
      concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd
      because on the whole it was not the small green pieces of paper that were
      unhappy.
